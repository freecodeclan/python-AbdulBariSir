# OOP's in Python
In Python object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. The main concept is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

The core OOP's principles are :

**1. Classes** are just the blue print of objects.

**2. Objects -**

**3. Inheritance**

**4. Encapsulation**  means combining all the related things together and wrapping them into the single capsule or box. 

**5. Polymorphism** simply means one name and different actions.

**6. Abstraction** is hiding unnecessary details from the user and providing only those functions which are useful to user. Abstraction can be achieved with the help of encapsulation.
