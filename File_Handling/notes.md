# File Handling in Python
File handling in Python refers to the process of working with files on your computer's filesystem. Python provides built-in functions and methods for creating, reading, writing, and manipulating files.

The key function for working with files in Python is the **open( )** function. The **open( )** function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

    file = open('file_name', 'r')
